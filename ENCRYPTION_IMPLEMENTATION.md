## Security Features

### Password Encryption:
- Uses bcrypt with salt rounds of 10
- Passwords are automatically hashed before saving to database
- Original passwords are never stored in plain text
- Password comparison uses secure bcrypt.compare() method

### Admin Account:
- Admin account created with encrypted password: `Adm!n12$$2`
- Password is hashed using the same bcrypt system as regular users
- Admin privileges are determined by username === 'admin'

## Testing Verification

✅ Password encryption working correctly
✅ New user signup encrypts passwords automatically  
✅ Admin account created with encrypted password
✅ Password verification working for both correct and incorrect passwords
✅ Navigation links added between signin and signup pages

## Usage Instructions

### For Admin Login:
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `Adm!n12$$2`

### For Users:
- Sign up process now automatically encrypts passwords
- Navigation between signin and signup is seamless with added links
- All existing functionality maintained

## Files Modified:
- `backend/models/user.model.js` - Added password encryption
- `backend/routes/users.js` - Updated for encrypted password handling
- `backend/create-encrypted-admin.js` - New admin creation script
- `frontend/src/components/signin.component.js` - Added signup link
- `frontend/src/components/create-user.component.js` - Added signin link  
- `frontend/src/App.js` - Added /signup route

All changes are backward compatible and the application is ready for production use with secure password handling.
